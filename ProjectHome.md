Sphider-Plus is an open-source GPL-licensed PHP search engine based on the original Sphider scripts created by Ando Saabas (www.sphider.eu).

In front of original Sphider additional mods, functions, template designs and debugging have been performed. For details about all changes, see the changelog.

Sphider-Plus requires PHP 5.

The names of Sphider-Plus folders and scripts are often the same like those of original Sphider. But the scripts are not interchangeable between Sphider and Sphider-Plus. Some messages have been added in the language files. You are invited to translate your native language and then to share the files with the community. Also mods, improvements and of course bug fixes are very welcome for future releases of Sphider-Plus.

Sphider-Plus is being maintained by [PHP Site Solutions](http://www.phpsitesolutions.com).
